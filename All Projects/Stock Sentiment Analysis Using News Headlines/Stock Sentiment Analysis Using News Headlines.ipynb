    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook, we will perform a very simple stock sentiment analysis using news headlines. The dataset contains top 25 headlines for a specific company. Label is the target column where value 0 means the headlines had a negative or no impact on the stock prices, while value 1 means the headlines had a positive impact on the stock prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a method to extract subjective information, such as opinions or emotions, from text. By analyzing the sentiment of news headlines, we can better understand the market's perception of a particular stock and potentially predict its future performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains news headlines from various sources. We will preprocess the text data, build a sentiment analysis model, and evaluate its performance. Our goal is to create a model that accurately predicts the sentiment of a stock based on the news headlines.\n",
